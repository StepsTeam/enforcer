    Support
        Human developers

    Scope
        Necessity due so that it can scan all LLM generated code
        Scan GenAI code
        All Languages (with top-level functions)
            from class-based languages
                Java, Ruby, C# < 9.0, Smalltalk

    Superiority
        Competitor scans are lower quality
        Borg Assimulation
        Individual tools
        Polyglot programming
        Best LLM
            Fine tune a LLM to write code that passes MicroScanner
        Moat / Protect: Emulate the competition

    Security
        Scanning (long checklist)
        Rust
        AppSec
        DevSecOps
        Omitting vulnerabilities in tool dependencies
        Compliance
            List all SOC2-like standards that can be facilitated (automatically)
        Avoiding native functions that pose security risks
            Is it a compliance concept?

    Supplimentation
        Determinism
        When you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail
        Industry leaders are giving too much responsibility to LLMs
        External deterministic software should be used to guide the LLMs

    Simplicity
        Convenience
            List the other uses (porting, refactoring, etc)
            folders
            procedural pipeline
        Drop-in replacement of all tools in CI/CD pipelines

    Style
        MicroScanner Bash pipeline  
            any developer can understand in 1 minute
        Separation
            architecture: Each tool in it's own folder
            Duplicate code is OK
        TrainTrack (mode)
            Simplify the code so that it can be ported

    Sizing
        min and max token count

    Standardization
        linting (fix mode)
            Smells
        static anaylisis (scan mode)

        Force Strict code
            style
            configurations
            tool plugins

        Developers can run other linters later (rather than configure)
        Developer disagreements
        Best practices
        Single way to release software. Always in the pipeline
        SARIF output for all tools (and compatibility with dashboards)
            Only other other outputs if paid? Conversion tools probably already exist

    Sequencing
        some tools prepare code for other tools
        linters before static analyzers

    Stability
        QA tools have bugs
        LLMs alone are not reliable
        Save stable implementations
        Hard to maintain plugins / Jenkins
        Mark prompts Handle false positives (during development)
            Ask ChatGPT how to develop the detection process

    

    Speed
        Bash version can be slow
        Rust version should be optimized for speed (after simplicity) ?
        Benchmarking 
        Performance

        parallel processing per file
            linting sync
            SAST async
                formatting output is async

        Installation (downloading) can be parallel ?
            Must have SKIP if already installed
            Must have SKIP if already cloned (and compiled)
                make a status in the codebase ?
        Fastest AST
        Fastest Token counter 

    Sentimentality

    Standalone binary
        any system, no dependencies, easy to install

    Sustainability 
        simple code that is easy to maintain
        Skill (dad losing cognitive)
        Write sustainable testable code

        Make sure test_ cases exist for each function


Review to make sure each point is limited to MicroScanner  ???

Review WIIFM (ask LLM to write it that way)
    so that

Rewrite as a PROMPT to the LLMs

Ask LLM about additional ideas to make MicroScanner the best
    Ask about pain points regarding tools
