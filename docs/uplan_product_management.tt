Product Management Is Dead, So What Are We Doing Instead? | Lenny & Friends Summit 2024
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93fCvFkY1Lg

good
morning I'm very excited to be here and
they thought what should we do bright
and early at the product leaders
conference let's just go ahead and nicks
product management entirely let's get
rid of it um we can all go enjoy a great
San Francisco October morning so I'm
here to tell you and I act I believe
this to be true this is not a hot take
for the sake of hot takes
product management is dead it or it will
be soon and so I'm here to talk about
what we're all going to do instead but
first what an amazing conference okay
everybody smile because you all never
get this let's take a
picture okay we got the picture we'll
see if the smiles are still there at the
end of the talk all right so uh you know
I've been saying this a lot but AI is
going to transform the role of product
design and Engineering faster than we
all expect and whenever I say this
people go yeah yeah yeah Claire and I
say no no no
faster than that and so I want you all
to think about the change the rate of
change in technology over the last 18 to
24 months things that candidly after two
decades of being in a product role I
never thought I would see a my lifetime
has now become kind of boring to me I
think the rate of chain is very fast and
our job is to not be surprised and so
when I tell my team about Building
Product strategy I say I'm not
interested in building a great product
for today I'm interested in thinking
about what our customers are going to
need from us in three five and 10 years
and building the product that's going to
push towards that future that we believe
in and I really believe the same goes
for Building Product teams I want to
imagine the product team of 18 months
from now three years from now 5 years
from now 10 years from now I want to
think about how that team's really going
to operate I want to play some bets on
what I think is going to change and I
want to build that
team but before I go there I'm just
going to tell a little story about baby
Claire CPO you know many many moons ago
and I know you all have Maybe started
new product leadership jobs and you've
got asked this question so you know
you're here you have some experience
what what's our product strategy anybody
even asked that question before yeah
okay great one person great this is a
great great conference um and I remember
doing this exercise of what's our great
product strategy and I went through this
exercise where I said Okay first I'm
going to talk to customers I'm going to
talk to a bunch of them I'm going to
take a bunch of notes and then I'm going
to talk to the team um I'm going talk to
sales which is money mouth Cowboy which
might also be sales we got CFO in the
glasses in engineering who's too cool to
even look at you we're going to talk to
the team we're going to say what you
know what do you think what what what
have you seen and then I'm going to
think really hard like I'm gonna take
all that information I put in my brain I
think so hard and I'm G to type and I'm
G to put it into this dock that says my
amazing strategy of course it's going to
be in Kota so I'm going to do this
amazing strategy and then I'm going to
take it back to the team but there
they're now annoyed because they don't
like what I came up with and I'm going
to get more feedback from this team and
then I'm going to think really hard
again I'll use my brain everything I
know about the market all my strategic
books that I've ever read in my life I'm
gonna you know think back to play bigger
and then I'm going to do my amazing
strategy V1 and then I'm going to give
it to the team and the team's going to
give me 8,000
comments and then you know another drill
a brain goes back into play and then I
have my amazing strategy final final
this one with a link to all the drafts
at the top so this I I I I legitimately
remember doing this it output this like
10-page document that I think was pretty
good it took me weeks and weeks and
weeks so many conference rooms when we
did that sort of thing and that was how
I built a product strategy the last time
I built a product strategy this is what
it looked like I dropped off my kids at
school I had done the customer calls and
talking to the people I put ja chat GPT
voice on my phone and I just prattled I
just did this blah and I asked hey
what's our product strategy after all my
prattling and guess what I got the same
damn 10 document 10 page paper on what
our product strategy was I of course sat
down on my laptop made it a little
better but I would say like for like it
was pretty good and that is the
difference in how product can operate I
think it's a perfect metaphor for how
product is changing so before you know
it took weeks to write and revise and
sharpen long product strategy now I'm
hanging out in my minivan talking to
chat GPT on my way to work you know
before you would take these days to
write feedback and requirements in a doc
and da and now you're taking 15 minutes
to scaffold out something that's 80%
good and then 45 minutes to sharpen and
then ship it uh you would draw wire
frames on paper I used to use paper like
draw wireframes on paper or balsamic if
you're being cute and then wait for
design to work on ux see I this is the
audience for a ballom joke um and now
you can share these fully functional
prototypes with your teams and customers
literally in minutes you can manually
pour through customer feedback everybody
has the spread the spreadsheet um for
ideas and priorities now you can
automate those insights with no code
tools and then finally there's slides
there's so many slides we're making
slides all the time and now we're making
slides but they're generated by AI so
this is you know before and and now this
isn't even the future and I think now
product work honestly takes less
time less
thought and and maybe less
PMS
so what does that mean I think it means
it could be become more fun but in order
for it to become more fun we have to do
what all of us are really fabulous at
which is straight up pivot so we're
going to figure out something else we're
going to kill product management but
we're replace it with something else and
so I'm going to start with a couple
pieces of advice on how to get there and
the first one is you need to become an
AI powered product team now and I think
there are three requirements of an AI
powered PM they automate themselves to
speed up delivery they add new skills
and they do more and then they multiply
their impact by teaching the team and
you know I really think you need to
automate yourself to speed up delivery
that's task number one and um Jay-Z was
asking me behind
back backstage she's saying how do you
do it all and then she goes AI That's
how you do it all including how I do
this talk so I was like how can I
automate chat PRD how can I automate
away all the things that PMS do with AI
and I made this to-do list and you'll
see how that to-do list was generated
with chat Purity as I go through it so
I'm going to give you a anti- to-do list
these are things that you should no
longer do on your own you should
automate these things immediately one
is draft documents don't do that that's
that's for suckers um two get and give
feedback first passive feedback you
shouldn't have to give you should get
feedback from AI or a tool writing
updates how many of you are writing
updates daily a lot no one no one's
writing updates no one's writing Str
okay we got one one product leader back
here one guy one guy and me okay uh
agenda summaries and action items out of
meetings prioritizing feature requests
monitoring goals and okrs even coming up
with goals and okrs keeping track of
competitors prepping for interviews
consolidating candidate feedback if
you're doing interviews telling customer
stories you know you're the keeper of oh
this feature is great because so and so
does this or so and so did that uh
making slides pretty don't do that and
then explaining product functionality
we're all just walking support knowledge
bases for our product areas none of this
you should be doing you should think
every every time I do one of these tasks
on this anti- to-do list how can I
automate it in the moment and help you
speed up delivery overall clear clear
the deck and I think there are very easy
ways basically my trick here is every
time I do one of those things and I
think in my heart I wish I didn't have
to do this I go spend four to seven
minutes trying to figure out if I can
manifest a way not to have to do it
about 80% of the time I get it done and
I ship
it and this is not about you know
there's this mix people say oh that
saves time but does it increase quality
and I'm just using this quote from
somebody on my team who says don't look
at it as how you can get to 100% look at
how you can get to 75% faster than
starting from zero and I think people
can save days um every week by
automating themselves and then I think
you really need to use that time to add
new skills and do more so this is where
we start thinking about how product
management is going to change and to
embarrass him I'm going to call out Cody
Cody's on our team he leads our um
product Innovation and incubation team
and Cody actually comes from devil so
he's an engineer and Cody has shown and
and he was in marketing so he's not a
product manager and Cody has just
learned how to be an edge prototyper
start building product en code and we
said hey Cody I'll give you chat PRD you
want to be a product manager and he's
like sure I'll be a product manager so
he already has this propensity to add
more skills this is a non-traditional
product manager coming into a product
leadership role and using AI to figure
out how to be a product product manager
but Cody got blocked he was building a
product and he's part of a Triad and
design had four other priorities and
Cody was blocked and instead of saying
I'm blocked and I'm a marketer and I'm
an engineering prototyper and I'm like
kind of a product manager just learning
how to do it now and crying he learned
how to be a designer so he started using
v.d to actually build wire like these
aren't even wireframes build beautiful
designs and prototypes for his product
as part of his package of requirements
to the team and now I mean bless him
he's starting to do PRS for frontend
code I mean this guy is out out of
control and what I think you need to
think about is these are the kind of
people that are going to come for
product jobs these are the kind of
people you're going to want to hire and
this is the breadth of skills that
you're really going to want on your team
and in yourself and then of course none
of that matters if it's just one person
if it's just a Cody as we say you have
to multiply your impact by teaching the
team so we actually have a project
building with AI Channel at launch
darkley um where every day we're sharing
different ways we're automating
ourselves asking for help building
things um and it's the most exciting
Channel and I post all the time things
that I build because I think as a
product leader you have to normalize
using these tools to accelerate and
build skills so that people don't feel
so bashful about it you also have to
fund it but we'll get to that in a
minute so this is what I think it takes
to be an AI powered pm and an AI powered
product
team and I think this is how we get to
this world where a product World takes
less time so you can spend more time
with users it takes less thought so you
can actually be more creative with the
time that you have and then has less PMS
with
I don't think you all are going to like
this I think uh maybe we want to talk
about this one and this is one of most
strongly held beliefs about the art of
product management which I've made a
career out of
is I think AI will collapse the talent
stack so what I mean is these jobs that
have been separate will start to become
one and that's really scary and it's a
big change but I don't believe and my
experience has been it doesn't happen to
break your team so first a quick
exercise God I'm trying to do arm
raising exercises and you all giving me
nothing so come along with me how many
of you have given an update in slack
this
week my God no one's working man okay
how many of you have written a document
this week okay we're all writing
documents all right how many of you have
done a design this
week few how many of you have written
code this week how many of you have
deployed code to production this week
okay that's th those those five people
that's what's coming for us so you know
before we really love this idea of the
product Triad this product engineering
design these leads maybe you had instead
of a stool you had a table you got data
in there uh surrounded by supporting
engineering and design resources I think
this is what has been classically the
platonic ideal of a product team for
quite some time
and I think what's the problem with this
is because they're all separate product
operates as a handoff mechanism I'm
going to handoff requirements to you
Design's going to hand off things to
engineering I'm going to make sure they
know engineering manager is going to
hand off things to engineering and
they're going to make sure that they
know things and it means you stay really
hands off with what actually gets built
and so what I think we're moving to now
is more of this generalist specialist so
you have specialists in product design
and engineering ing but at least in my
organization they're really expected to
participate across the building process
they're expected to do the work that
needs to get done to move the project
forward and the operating principle that
we Embrace at launch darkley we call
this there are no Lanes so you know
there's like stay in your lane and we're
like there are no Lanes if there's
something to get done and you have the
skill to do it culturally we Embrace
getting it done but that's now and I
think even this kind of freaks people
out because people like their Lanes they
like to know products excellent at
product stuff so they're going to
product the hell out of things and
design is great at design stuff and
they're going to design things and it
gets really uncomfortable where you say
well product can do pretty bang up job
at design and design actually knows how
to push react code and Engineering could
you please just write a PRD yourself you
know what we need to do and so I think
this already freaks people out but this
this really freaks people out so this is
what I think is coming for us very soon
I think you're going to see what I would
call an AI power Triple Threat basically
one person that can do engineering
design product as a lead of a team which
includes AI tools agents and platforms
as part of that team and I think this is
what we're going to hire for and what's
really interesting is they may spike in
engineering they may spike in classic
product management they may spike in
design but they're going to need to know
how to do it all and that Triad goes
away and what I think is really
interesting about the tri going away is
I think we all believe that small teams
can generally move faster than big teams
I kind of believe individuals can move
faster than small teams and so this is
kind of an exercise in thinking how fast
can opinionated product leadership in a
small team move things forward given the
tools that they need and then actually I
think it's like maybe everything so you
saw those guys hiding in the corner I
mean like who knows what we're going to
pull into this Vortex of this new role
but I do think product managers are ALS
Al going to be expected to be more
commercially oriented think about Pro
marketing more uh use tools for data and
so maybe actually we're both dead and
reanimated as
everything and it's scary people don't
like this they don't like it but it
doesn't have to be scary I you know I
have a friend that said said this the
other day I thought it was really
interesting the only people that need to
be worried are the people acting like
they don't need to be worried which is
if you can imagine this future and you
say you know Claire's up here trying to
give a talk that people tweet out but I
buy into her fundamental thesis that
things are going to change dramatically
think about how that changes for you
prepare yourself prepare your team
change in advance and make the moves you
need to do to be awesome in this new era
as opposed to
Obsolete and so I think about this AI
will never do this thing is super naive
but AI can help me do anything is really
inspiring and it gets me amped up about
I'm gotting some nods gets me really
amped up about what is possible to build
and put in the market and create and I
just think that's so
thrilling okay and then this is the the
last part which is product leaders AI is
coming for you too so you're like yeah
yeah product managers let's just get
them and do a whole bunch more stuff
with less headcount that sounds great
yeah and then all the SAS providers are
like yeah AI agents my tool is your
solution they love it but it's never
coming for us right there's never going
to be an aico no no no it it's coming
for you too and I think we all need to
be prepared for this change and so first
thing is we need to be prepared to
manage whatever the hell this thing is I
mean this is totally different than what
most of us are thinking about in terms
of what our teams are and I think this
means that we have to get more
commercial skills in our teams
especially for my friends out there in
B2B Enterprise more technical skills we
are going to be expected to manage
people who code I'm a cpto basically
it's already happening I'm seeing more
and more of us that are bringing these
functions together when more and more of
the individuals have shared shared
skills you're going to have to think
about how you manage that you're going
to have to think about budg budgeting
for headcount versus budgeting for
agents and tools and how that changes
how you think about the investment in
R&D that you're making and then I'm
saying we're going to have these
artisanally crafted team topologies
which is basically like the team is
going to be built for the thing that
needs to get done we can't all be
prescriptive about the Triad as the only
way to get something done I say organize
around motivated individuals if somebody
comes in with this globul shape of
skills I would want to build a team
around that if somebody spikes on
product and I need that skill on a team
I'm going to build that team around them
and we're going to have to get really
creative with how we design teams in
order to be
successful uh the other thing I would
think about is your experience and your
strategy remember my minivan story is
becoming a commodity so this is a great
article in leny's newsletter about how
close is AI to replacing product
managers the punchline here is they had
like two visions the AI generated one
one because of quality even though
people knew it was Ai and so I think
just thinking about like how special is
all that hard thinking um is really
important and so I think you need to
skill up and build a moat around what
you can bring to the table and what you
might be able to bring to the table is
running and building and scaling these
AI powered
teams and it's going to happen really
fast to start now the reason why I have
the dancing bunny emojis is I sat next
to the CEO you would have never guessed
wasn't from a fancy Tech forward company
was sort of like non-te company and he
was sitting there said what are you
doing he's like oh I'm building my
digital twin and I don't let anybody in
the company ask me questions till they
ask my digital twinner question and I
was like this guy's got a digital twin I
don't have a digital twin and so it
really made me think it's going to
happen fast and I'm even behind so you
really need to start now so here's the
tldr on reanimating products since I I
killed it you really need to become an
AI powered product team now ai is going
to collapse the talent stack there are
five people here apparently that have
already done it um but care for your
culture care for your organization plan
accordingly and it will be fine and then
product leaders that's coming for you
too so join me in thinking what that
three to fiveyear Future can look like
and manifest it in your team and so if I
have any advice to you it's go find
those AI powered triple threats give
them power and give them budget I think
you'll be really really happy you did
thank you so much I really appreciate it
[Applause]
